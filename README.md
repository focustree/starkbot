If you want to try it out live, follow those steps:
1. [Create a Starknet ID](https://starknet.id/) and verify your discord user id.
2. [Mint a BRIQ NFT](https://briq.construction) with the same wallet
3. [Go to the Focus Tree's discord](https://discord.gg/GSaSNyZs). You should get assigned the `ðŸ§± Briq` role.
4. You can try to add you own rules by typing `/starkbot-add-rule` in #general

## Bot Setup

### Using our infra

1. [Invite starkbot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=993439991822815292&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to your Discord server
2. Assign it a role and put this role at the top of your role list (so it can manage the below roles)
3. Create your first rule

```
/starkbot-add-rule
```

### On-premise

You can run the already prepared docker image:
```
docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/gabsn/starkbot-discord-bot:v1
```
You need to create a `.env` file with your own discord and firebase credentials:
```
ENV=prod
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
FIREBASE_CONFIG={...}
```
## Roadmap

### Features

- [x] Create / Delete / List rules
- [x] Automatically assign roles based on having or not an NFT
- [ ] Specify `min` and `max` balance value in rules to make the difference between whales and small holders.
- [ ] Support rules on NFT attributes to create different roles inside the same NFT collection
- [ ] Support templating engine to create dynamic roles (ex: `LVL: <player_level>`)

### Infra

- [ ] Make sure Firebase rules are properly setup as well as discord listeners to make sure only admins can add / delete rules
- [ ] Add monitoring to get alerted when the bot crashes
- [ ] Breakdown the different async functions in independent services to increase the scalability
- [ ] Create a Github workflow to automatically deploy the `starkbot` in production
