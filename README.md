## Bot Setup

### Using our infra

If you want to try it out on your server, follow those steps:

1. [Create a Starknet ID](https://starknet.id/) and verify your discord user id.
2. [Mint a BRIQ NFT](https://briq.construction) with the same wallet
3. [Invite starkbot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=993439991822815292&permissions=268435456&scope=bot%20applications.commands) on your Discord server
4. Assign it a role and put this role at the top of your role list (so it can manage the below roles).  
Give it a role that has the enough permissions!
5. Create your own rules by typing `/starkbot-add-rule` in #general

```
/starkbot-add-rule
```

### On-premise

You can run the already prepared docker image:

```
docker run -d --restart always --env-file .env ghcr.io/gabsn/starkbot-discord-bot:bb0107b
```

You need to create a `.env` file with your own discord and firebase credentials:

```
ENV=dev

DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=

STARKNET_ID_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0798e884450c19e072d6620fefdbeb7387d0453d3fd51d95f5ace1f17633d88b
STARKNET_ID_INDEXER_URL=https://goerli.indexer.starknet.id/field_data_to_id
VERIFIER_DECIMAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=2858829565965467824506234522366406559425492229537050207406969294731822669741
DISCORD_TYPE=28263441981469284

AWS_PROFILE=
AWS_REGION=
DYNAMODB_TABLE_GUILD_DEV=
DYNAMODB_TABLE_STARKNET_ID_DEV=

JWT_KEY=
RST_KEY=
API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
```

- Fill the 2 missing DISCORD variables with your bot application credentials
- Fill the 3 missing AWS variables with your AWS profile (only for stack deployment) and region, as well as your DynamoDB tables names
- Fill the 2 missing token key with generated tokens (see website section below)

## Roadmap

### Features

- [x] Create / Delete / List rules
- [x] Automatically assign roles based on having or not an NFT
- [x] Specify `min` and `max` balance value in rules to make the difference between whales and small holders.
- [ ] Allow creating more sophisticated roles based on multiple NFTs.
- [ ] Support rules on NFT attributes to create different roles inside the same NFT collection
- [ ] Support templating engine to create dynamic roles (ex: `LVL: <player_level>`)

### Infra

- [x] Make sure only admins can add / delete rules
- [x] Create a Github workflow to automatically deploy the `starkbot` in production
- [x] Move DBMS from Firebase to DynamoDB
- [ ] Create an EKS cluster and deploy Starkbot into it to increase scalability
- [ ] Add monitoring to get alerted when the bot crashes
- [ ] Breakdown the different async functions in independent services to increase the scalability


## Starkbot website

You need to create two different secrets stored in environment variables for the website : `JWT_KEY` and `RST_KEY`. You have to include them in the global *.env* file

You can use the following command to generate random secrets:
```
openssl rand -hex 32 
```

Run the website from the root with 
```
pnpm web:launch
```

You can then reach the website at `http://localhost:3000`
