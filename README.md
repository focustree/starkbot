</a>

## Bot Setup

1. Invite `starkbot` to your Discord server
2. Assign it a role and put this role at the top of your role list (so it can manage the below roles)
3. Create your first rule
```
starkbot-add-rule
```

## Roadmap

### Features

- [x] Create / Delete / List rules
- [x] Automatically assign roles based on having or not an NFT
- [ ] Specify `min` and `max` balance value in rules to make the difference between whales and small holders.
- [ ] Support rules on NFT attributes to create different roles inside the same NFT collection
- [ ] Support templating engine to create dynamic roles (ex: `LVL: <player_level>`)

### Infra

- [ ] Make sure Firebase rules are properly setup as well as discord listeners to make sure only admins can add / delete rules
- [ ] Add monitoring to get alerted when the bot crashes
- [ ] Breakdown the different async functions in independent services to increase the scalability
- [ ] Create a Github workflow to automatically deploy the `starkbot` in production
